`This is the start of your first blog post.`  

This is what JigSaw told me as I booted things up for my first (serious-ish) blogging attempt.
I have been thinking about creating a blog for quite sometime. And finally my procrastination was beaten, this blog is here.  
  
I am not very sure about the direction for this blog. I'll be mostly documenting about the things I've been doing and an occasional `thought_dump()` will be present.  

The idea of running an entire blog from a Git repository seems interesting and a bit bewitching.  

I have interest in a lot of things. Consequently, there will be writings about a lot of things. And there will be a bunch of Computer Science, Programming and Mathematics.  
You have been warned.
